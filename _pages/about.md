## My Background

I am currently an undergrad at Northeastern University where I am advised by
<a href="https://www.ece.neu.edu/people/singh-hanumant">Hanu Singh</a>,
<a href="https://www.ece.neu.edu/people/everett-michael">Michael Everett</a> and, <a href="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/rosen-david/">David M. Rosen</a>
on a broad set of topics in robot navigation and perception.
My goal is to develop algorithms that enable robotic navigation in challenging environments, such as the ocean, with a particular interest in applying tools from mathematical optimization theory. I will be applying to PhD programs for a Fall 2027 start.

In my freetime I enjoy playing soccer, running, skiing, videogames (strategy, simulation, and action-adventure), Star Trek and, Star Wars.
