# Undergrad Research, From an Undergrad  
*A real view of the freedom, the confusion, and the payoff*

When people describe undergrad research, they usually emphasize the exciting parts. You get to work on real problems. You get access to tools and ideas that are not in most classes. You get to be around people doing work that actually pushes the field forward.

All true.

But the most defining part of undergrad research, at least for me, is something less glamorous  
**you are given a level of freedom that you are not fully trained to handle yet**

And that is not a complaint. That is the whole point. Research is where you learn how to operate without a rubric, how to make decisions with incomplete information, and how to keep going when you are not sure whether you are doing things “right.”

This post is my perspective as an undergrad researcher for other undergrads who are thinking about joining a lab, who just joined one, or who are trying to figure out why research feels so different from classes.

## You get out what you put in

The simplest thing I have learned is also the most important  
**how much you put in is how much you get out**

When I first started, I was doing the bare minimum. I showed up, I tried to help, and I stayed involved, but I did not *own* anything. It did not feel rewarding, because honestly, I was not giving it enough for it to be rewarding.

The shift happened when I started investing real time. Not perfect time. Not heroic time. Just consistent time where I was actively trying to move something forward.

Once I did that, research started to feel completely different. The same lab, the same people, the same resources  
but now I was actually building momentum.

If you want research to feel meaningful, treat it like something you are building, not something you are attending.

## Freedom is the best part and the hardest part

In classes, structure is everywhere. You know what to learn, when it is due, and what “done” looks like. Even hard classes still have rails.

Research does not.

In research, it is normal to have weeks where you are not sure what the next step is. It is normal to feel like you are missing something obvious. It is normal to spend a long time chasing an idea that turns out to be wrong.

I used to interpret that feeling as failure. Now I interpret it as the environment doing what it is supposed to do. The goal is not to always feel confident. The goal is to learn how to operate when you are not.

### The subtle distinction that helped me
You are not alone in research. People will help you.  
But you are still responsible for making your work move.

That means  
* you have to ask for feedback  
* you have to show what you tried  
* you have to bring specific questions  
* you have to keep a thread going even when no one is checking on you daily  

This is not because mentors do not care. It is because research groups are busy and the default mode is not hand holding. You have to create the structure you need.

## Become comfortable being uncomfortable

One of the hardest parts of research is emotional, not technical. It does not feel good to not know the answer. And research is basically choosing to not know the answer on purpose.

The only way I have found to deal with that is to practice being uncomfortable without panicking.

That does not mean tolerating confusion forever. It means learning how to sort unknowns into two categories

1. **Things I must understand right now to make progress**
2. **Things I can temporarily hand wave while I keep moving**

That skill makes you faster. If you treat every gap in your understanding as an emergency, you get stuck constantly. If you treat every gap as irrelevant, you build on sand. Progress is learning what matters *today*.

## What mentorship feels like when it works

As an undergrad, one of the most motivating experiences is being treated like your ideas matter.

Some of my mentors treated me like a peer in the best sense  
not because I had the same expertise, but because they took my questions seriously and respected my attempts.

That changed everything. It made me more willing to ask questions. More willing to propose ideas early. More willing to admit what I did not understand.

I think that is what good mentorship looks like from the undergrad side

* You are not expected to already know everything  
* You are expected to try  
* Your effort is taken seriously  
* Your questions are welcomed  
* You are pushed, but not dismissed

## It is okay to be uncertain about your path

I did not start in robotics. My path shifted during undergrad, and that was only possible because people around me were willing to support me while I figured it out.

If you are reading this and you are not sure what you want to do long term, that is normal.

You do not need to be certain on day one. You just need to be committed to genuinely finding out.

That means showing up consistently, putting real time in, and being honest with yourself about whether you like the process. If you end up staying, great. If you end up pivoting, also great. Either way, you will leave with skills and perspective that transfer.

## The expectations I wish someone told me earlier

This is not a formal contract. It is just what I think makes research work *as an undergrad*.

### 1. Time commitment
Progress requires time that is both scheduled and protected. In my experience, meaningful momentum often starts around **10 to 15 hours per week**, and more in the summer.

Some weeks will be lighter. That is fine. The key is consistency and communication.

### 2. Communication
Mentors cannot read your mind. If you are stuck, say it. If you are unsure what to do next, say it. If you have been sitting on a question for a week, ask it.

The best research interactions happen when you show up with something concrete

* what you tried  
* what happened  
* what you think is going wrong  
* what you want to try next  
* what you need help deciding  

### 3. Organization and documentation
I used to think documentation was optional. It is not.

The fastest way to waste time in research is to repeat your own mistakes because you did not write them down.

A minimum level of organization makes everything easier

* keep notes of problems and solutions  
* write down hypotheses and results  
* use version control like [git](https://git-scm.com/)  
* keep a running list of questions for your next meeting  
* save commands, plots, and configs you used so you can reproduce them  

### 4. Meetings
A weekly meeting helps a lot, even if it is short. It forces you to summarize what happened and decide what matters next. It also prevents you from drifting for weeks without realizing it.

### 5. Being in the lab matters
A lot of work can be done remotely, but being physically around your lab makes research easier as an undergrad.

It reduces friction to ask questions. It helps you absorb how people think. It makes you feel like part of something bigger than your current bug.

Even if you do not live in the lab, spending regular time there changes the experience.

### 6. Credit and recognition
If you do meaningful work, you deserve recognition. That might look like authorship, a poster, a talk, or just having your contribution clearly acknowledged. Recognition is part of a healthy research culture.

## A weekly structure that helped me

Research is open ended, but your week does not have to be.

Here is a structure that helped me turn “I should do research” into “I am making progress.”

| Habit | What I do | Why it helps |
|---|---|---|
| One running notebook | short daily notes, links, decisions | prevents repeated confusion |
| One question list | questions I will ask in my next meeting | makes mentor time efficient |
| One weekly deliverable | one tangible output by Friday | creates momentum |
| One experiment plan | hypothesis, test, result | turns effort into learning |

A “deliverable” can be small but real  
* a working script  
* a plot with a conclusion  
* a debugging writeup  
* a short memo describing a failure mode  
* a minimal example that reproduces a bug  

The point is not to be impressive every week. The point is to keep moving.

## Closing

Undergrad research is not about already being an expert. It is about learning how to become one.

You will feel lost sometimes. You will be unsure whether you are doing things correctly. You will have weeks where nothing works. That does not mean you are failing. That means you are doing research.

If you show up consistently, put real effort in, ask for feedback, and learn to operate while uncertain, the freedom that felt scary at the start becomes the reason research is so rewarding.

And eventually, you become the person who helps the next undergrad feel like they belong.
