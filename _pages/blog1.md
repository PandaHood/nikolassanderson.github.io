# Undergrad Research, From an Undergrad  

 {% include figure.html path="assets/img/F1-Fith.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %} 
<small>My research project was building an autonmous off-road car.</small>

When people describe undergrad research, they usually emphasize the exciting parts. You get to work on real problems. You get access to tools and ideas that are not in most classes. You get to be around people doing work that actually pushes the field forward.

All true.

But the most defining part of undergrad research, at least for me, is something less glamorous  
**you are given a level of freedom that you are not fully trained to handle yet**

And that is not a complaint. That is the whole point. Research is where you learn how to operate without a rubric, how to make decisions with incomplete information, and how to keep going when you are not sure whether you are doing things “right.”

This post is my perspective as an undergrad researcher for other undergrads who are thinking about joining a lab, who just joined one, or who are trying to figure out why research feels so different from classes.

## You get out what you put in

The simplest thing I have learned is also the most important  
**how much you put in is how much you get out**.

Joining a lab is as much of a trial to see if you like them as it is for you. However, if their are things you want to acheive its up to you to figure them out.


## Freedom is the best part and the hardest part

In classes, structure is everywhere. You know what to learn, when it is due, and what “done” looks like. However research is different.

In research, it is normal to have weeks where you are not sure what the next step is. It is normal to feel like you are missing something obvious. It is normal to spend a long time chasing an idea that turns out to be wrong. The best way to get around this is to understand research progress can take shape in basically any form. Results are often the most visible to others and rewarding for oneself, but doing a deep literature review to undertsand current research gaps is important, designing productivity tools that will accelerate your work, and focusing your research question to be more precise and scientific. Everything you do is an investment and it is discoruaging to not always be at the final stage 



### The subtle distinction that helped me
You are not alone in research. People will help you and importanlty want you to succeed.  
But you are still responsible for making your work move.

That means  
* you have to ask for feedback  
* you have to show what you tried  
* you have to bring specific questions  
* you have to keep a thread going even when no one is checking on you daily  

This is not because mentors do not care. It is because research groups are busy and the default mode is not hand holding. You have to create the structure you need.

I think the best piece of advice that resonates with me (not even research specific advice) is from Presidant [Barack Obama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNY4UFaHbP4) where he said "Just learn how to get stuff done". If you can learn this you will succeed in anything -- even research!

## Become comfortable being uncomfortable

One of the hardest parts of research is not a technical one and that i not knowing the answer. That doesn't feel good but in research we activly choose to not know the answer on purpose.

The only way I have found to deal with that is to practice being uncomfortable without panicking.

That does not mean tolerating confusion forever. It means learning how to sort unknowns into two categories

1. **Things I must understand right now to make progress**
2. **Things I can temporarily hand wave while I keep moving**

That skill makes you faster. If you treat every gap in your understanding as an emergency, you get stuck constantly. PIf you can figure out what you need to know and what you don't then you can use your time more efficently on things that will make your progress faster.

## What mentorship feels like when it works

As an undergrad, one of the most motivating experiences is being treated like your ideas matter. It funnily this came from the feeling of not being afraid of my mentors.This is becasue my mentors treated me like a peer in the best sense  
not because I had the same expertise, but because they took my questions seriously and respected my attempts. 
I think that is what good mentorship looks like from the undergrad side

* You are not expected to already know everything  
* You are expected to try  
* Your effort is taken seriously  
* Your questions are welcomed  
* You are pushed, but not dismissed 

There are 2 great blog posts from a PhD student at MIT CSAIL from [Davis Blalock](https://dblalock.github.io/how-to-undergrad-research/) and Prof. [Rose Wang](https://rosewang2008.github.io/blog/2021/01/03/undergrad-research-advice.html) who give a great perspective on undergrad research from a mentors perspective.

## The expectations I wish someone told me earlier

This is not a formal contract. It is just what I think makes research work *as an undergrad*.

### 1. Time commitment
I am an odd one out as I spend basically the full work-day in the lab, but generally I have seen undergrads succeed with **10-15** hours per week. This is of course variable but you need to make it a prioity for atleast some amount of time to make progress. I used to always push off saying I will have free time tommorrow I just need to finish my classwork and I never made any progress. 

### 2. Communication
The one thing I have always struggled with was communicating issues I encountered. My mentors couldn't read my mind as much as I wish they could. Being stuck and confused is the normal part of the research process but being able to communicate the problems (and successes!) in a way that is constructive is key.

The best research interactions happen when you show up with something concrete

* what you tried  
* what happened  
* what you think is going wrong  
* what you want to try next  
* what you need help deciding  

This makes it easier for your mentor to help you and forces you to really get to the bottom of what is not working well. Sometimes when I follow all those points I end up coming up with my own solution without ever talking to my mentor. The most important thing that a mentor will appreciate is you took some initative and thought about the problem. **Remember** you are not expeceted to know everything, just show you tried and they will always be willing to help. 

### 3. Organization and documentation
The bain of my existance is documentation. I think I don't write documentation because if I run into an issue I will forever steer clear of anything that could cause that again (which doesn't actually happen). The fastest way to waste time in research is to repeat your own mistakes because you did not write them down. Another point to emphasise is that writing is a key part in the thinking process. Coding is the main way in robotics to get results and verify your work but it's important to know that you are playing with fire when writing code you don't understand enough of. Its okay to not be sure of everything but make sure you know what you don't and then it makes debugging easier. 

I try to keep a minimum level of organization makes everything easier

* keep notes of problems and solutions  
* write down hypotheses and results  
* use version control like
* keep a running list of questions for your next meeting  
* save commands, plots, and configs you used so you can reproduce them  

### 4. Meetings
A weekly meeting helps a lot, even if it is short. It forces you to summarize what happened and decide what matters next. It also prevents you from drifting for weeks without realizing it. I would always push to have a weekly meeting — it forces your mentor to take you seriously, especially early on, and you get important face time and feedback. It can feel like a lot to always have something to present, but research isn't linear and progress can look different at different stages. Even if it's a casual meeting to discuss other research papers that interest you, it's still valuable.

### 5. Being in the lab matters
A lot of work can be done remotely especially in my field, but being physically around your lab makes research easier as an undergrad.

It reduces friction to ask questions. It helps you absorb how people think. It makes you feel like part of something bigger. I have basically become fully integrated into the lab being treated as a PhD student by all the current members. The professor takes my idea's seriously and when people see you do work it goes a long way. You also make a lot of friends when in close proximity with eachother, I have close relationships with the other undergrads in my lab and great mentor-mentee relationship with the PhD students. These relationships are what make research easier when it gets hard. We are human after all! We love having a connection.

## Closing

Undergrad research is not about already being an expert. It is about learning how to become one.

You will feel lost sometimes. You will be unsure whether you are doing things correctly. You will have weeks where nothing works. That does not mean you are failing. That means you are doing research.

If you show up consistently, put real effort in, ask for feedback, and learn to operate while uncertain, the freedom that felt scary at the start becomes the reason research is so rewarding.

And eventually, you become the person who helps the next undergrad feel like they belong.
