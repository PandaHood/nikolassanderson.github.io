# No Guts, No Glory: Leading a Marine Robotics Team as an Undergrad

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/nuwave-team.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

One of the few constants in my time at Northeastern is this Marine Robotics team. It has taught me a lot technically, but more importantly it has shaped who I am as a person and how I want to lead professionally.

If any saying encapsulates this team, this year, and this experience, it is **No Guts, No Glory**. To me, that does not mean being reckless. It means being resilient. It means holding composure when plans collapse and still finding a way to execute. It means taking responsibility seriously, even when the pressure is real and the system is fragile.

This post is my perspective as an undergrad who grew into leadership over a few seasons. I never joined thinking I would run a subsystem, and I definitely never joined expecting to become project lead. It “just kind of happened” in the way most growth happens: one responsibility at a time, one hard week at a time, one late night at a time.

## Why this team mattered so much to me

Before marine robotics, I drifted between clubs. I liked engineering, but I did not have a place where commitment was the expectation. I wanted a team environment that felt closer to a sport. People depend on you, effort compounds, and the final outcome is bigger than any individual contribution.Marine robotics ended up being exactly that. On top of that I have found a core group of people who have pushed me to be better. 

## Year 1: Joining as an electrical member

I joined marine robotics as an electrical team member at the end of the spring semester of 2023. I was new, and I honestly just wanted to be useful.

At first, “useful” meant doing whatever needed to get done. A lot of that work was behind the scenes, like making props so we could film our video for qualification. It was not glamorous, but it taught me a core lesson early:

**teams run on trust, and trust is built by reliability.**

Small tasks finished on time matter. Showing up matters. Communicating clearly matters. Those are the habits that earn you more responsibility later.

This first year was also when I learned what it actually feels like to be on a team. Not just joining a group chat, but being part of a crew that is building one system together, with one shared deadline.

## Year 2: Building the buoyancy controlled float

The next year I was given more responsibility: designing a **buoyancy controlled float**.

I did not have a leadership title. I was just a normal member. But that project was the first time I truly felt the weight of dependency. Other people were planning around my subsystem. Mechanical needed constraints and mounting. Software needed interfaces. The mission plan assumed certain behaviors. Suddenly, progress in other areas was waiting on me.

That year taught me that leadership starts before the title.

The moment someone else cannot move forward until you do, you are leading something, whether you realize it or not.

It also taught me a practical truth about engineering teams:

**ownership is not about credit, it is about responsibility.**

If it is your subsystem, you track the failure modes, you document what matters, and you make sure the rest of the team is never surprised at the last minute.

## Year 3: Co electrical lead and float lead

The following year I became co electrical lead and float lead. This was the transition from “doing work” to “directing effort.”

I had to learn how to manage others, get people to work together, and steer toward a common goal. I had to break big tasks into concrete pieces. I had to make the “next step” obvious for newer members. I had to build systems that kept progress moving even when everyone was busy.

This is where I realized that the hardest part of leading technical work is not always the technical part.

It is the coordination.

A good plan is not enough. You need a plan that fits the reality of student schedules, uneven experience levels, and the unpredictability of hardware. That means writing tasks down, keeping interfaces simple, and making sure people always know what success looks like for the week.

  <summary><strong>What I learned co leading (click to expand)</strong></summary>

- You cannot “motivate” people into progress without clarity  
- People do better work when they understand why the task matters  
- The fastest way to lose momentum is to let tasks stay vague  
- Meetings are only useful if they end with concrete next steps  
- Teaching scales better than doing everything yourself

## Year 4: Sole electrical lead

This year I became sole electrical lead. I designed the PCB from the ground up and became responsible for one of our robot’s core systems.

There is a different kind of pressure that comes with knowing:

**if my subsystem does not work, we do not have a robot.**

It also forced me to make harder decisions. When deadlines get close, you have to decide who you can rely on to deliver and when you need to step in yourself. You have to decide who to bring to competition. You have to balance mentorship with risk. You want to give people chances, but you also cannot gamble the entire robot on a task that might not be finished.

I did not love that part. But it taught me what professional leadership actually requires which is making decisions that are not personal, even when they feel personal.

## Competition: the week that tested everything

Leaving the 2024 MATE ROV Competition, the team was fueled by a competitive fire I had not seen before. We embarked on one of the most ambitious engineering overhauls I have ever seen attempted for the 2025 competition. We developed an entirely new ROV frame, two versions of custom PCBs, and an updated buoyancy controlled float design.

That is not to say everything went right.

Two days before our pool run, the Raspberry Pi and the antenna we were using on our buoyancy controlled float shorted. We had to completely adapt our strategy and rewire the system.

On top of that, a broken controller derailed our first run. We had to live code a fix just to get points on the board.

After all of that, we went back to the pool to fix everything. In the five hours between runs we recoded the float to earn more points, replaced the faulty controller, dealt with camera overheating issues, and made it to the second run with less than thirty minutes to spare.

The second run did not go perfectly either. We aimed for ambitious tasks early because we needed them to be competitive. In some ways we paid the price. We drifted into another zone while trying to remove a sacrificial anode for an offshore windfarm and needed tether support to get back. But the whole team kept its composure and put together a strong pool run.

It was not perfect. But it was resilient. And that is the point.

At the end of the competition, we placed top 10 and took home the **Guts and Glory** award for the resilience we showed. 


I think this anecdote shows how much this team means to me and to others. I am proud to be apart of a team of people just as dedicated who push me to be better everytime I step into the lab.

## The leadership lessons I am taking with me

### 1. Reliability beats brilliance
The most valuable person on a student engineering team is not always the smartest person. It is the person who consistently delivers, communicates clearly, and stays calm when things go wrong.

### 2. Structure is not restrictive, it is supportive
Clear tasks, clear interfaces, and simple documentation make it easier for everyone to contribute and succeed. Good structure reduces stress.

### 3. Teaching scales, doing everything does not
If the leaders do everything, the team becomes fragile. If the leaders teach, the team becomes resilient.

### 4. Pressure reveals priorities
When deadlines hit, your values show up in your behavior. I learned what I care about: supporting people, protecting the team culture, and still holding a high technical bar.

## Next year: becoming project lead

This upcoming year I will be project lead of the entire club.

I never thought I would get to this point, and I never saw myself as a leader. It just kind of happened this way. I grew into someone both technically capable and leadership capable.

What I care about most now is keeping the culture that inspired my cohort and will keep inspiring the younger members.

I have seen how this club has influenced people’s careers. Many teammates now want to work in marine robotics or engineering because of what they experienced here. As a senior member of the team, I have had a lot of fun. Now, as the person in charge, I want to make sure we keep that spark alive.

## Closing

This team has been one of the most meaningful parts of my time at Northeastern.

It taught me how to build real systems under real constraints. It taught me how to handle pressure without falling apart. It taught me how to lead in a way that is calm, responsible, and people focused.

No Guts, No Glory is not a slogan to me. It is a description of what it takes to keep going when the plan collapses two days before the run.

And it is a description of who I have become because of this team.
